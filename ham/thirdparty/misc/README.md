## Memory

- aligned and counted memory allocation/deallocation: `memory/memory.cpp/hpp`
- output an array into a text file (one entry per line, using `<<` operator on elements): `memory/array_to_file.hpp`

## Debug

- some very simple macros for executing code only in debug compilation mode: `debug/debug.hpp`
